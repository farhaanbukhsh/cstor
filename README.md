cStor is a resilient storage engine built with proven building blocks of 
storage components. The storage block layer is derived from the user space ZFS 
inherited from the proven OpenSolaris stack. The volumes can be accessed via 
iSCSI Target which is derived from Linux to BSD port. Both of these core 
components of cStor have been field tested at thousands of installations
for many years.
